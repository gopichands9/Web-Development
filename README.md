<h1> Personal Website </h1>

<p> It is just a Static Web page with basic HTML and CSS. Created for fun and to kill some time <br>
  It's always a good practice to have a glance on basics <br>
  My suggestion for this web page is to use chrome in desktop mode (window size = 100%) for better view <br>
