# Web-Development

<h1> Personal Website </h1>

<p> It is just a Static Web page with basic HTML and CSS. Created for fun and to kill some time <br>
  It's always a good practice to have a glance on basics <br>
  My suggestion for this web page is to use chrome in desktop mode (window size = 100%) for better view <br>

<h1> TinDog-Clone </h1>
<p> Recreated TinDog webpage using HTML, CSS and BootStrap <br>
  Played with BootStrap more this time <br>
  My suggestion is to clone the website you like and debug them in browser to understand the basics of web development concepts like layout, Grid, Buttons, and many more </br>
